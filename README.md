# Pretty directory server

This little project serves as a slightly better than default directory listing with some utils. I use this to view my recon data hosted on my VPS but you can do whatever you want with it.

## Instructions

- Clone the repo
- `bundle install`
- Modify the `config.yml` file to set the directory you want to serve
- `ruby server.rb`
